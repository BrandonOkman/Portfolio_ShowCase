## Purpose
The Purpose of my Portfolio is to showcase my work I have accomplished throughout my coding career. I hope my talents display the level of work needed to compete for even the toughest jobs. As I learn more I am able to use my abilities to improve n all areas of web development. This portfolio also gives the proper ways in which I can be reached for any work needed doing.
