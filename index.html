                <p>Enjoying what I do is very important to me. On my down time I enjoy spending time with my dogs. I love sports, both
                    watching and playing, although the playing part has slowed down. I was fortunate enough to grow up in south Florida where sports was a year round activity. After graduating high school I moved to Orlando to further pursue my
                    education at the University of Central Florida. Iâ€™m extremely creative and that lead me to pursue my passion in film. I now own a few
                    businesses and am excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>

                <p>Throughout life and work experiences I have picked up many skills that helped me to move forward and succeed in my goals. My work in film taught me one of the most valuable lessons, Teamwork. Whether at the top or the bottom communication is a key skill. My superb ability to communicate keeps my teams running smooth and maintaining efficiency.I pride myself on my ability to get my point across without degrading or stressing my team out. As a buyer for large companies I honed in on my listening abilities. I learned to pick up on cues and understand the clients needs even when they don't fully grasp what they want. Most clients wont be good at getting the picture in their head out so its very important to grasp all the cues you can and make something they can be proud of. My ability to look at the greater picture before jumping into a project has made me a great consultant as well as helped as a CEO. Ownership of businesses has allowed me to see the other side of the table. Its taught me to increase my skills as a leader and mentor. I believe my communication skills are put on display when it comes to group work and getting the best out of everyone. </p>
